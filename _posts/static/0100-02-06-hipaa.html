<h1>HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>

<h4>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</h4>
<ol type="I">
<li><h5>DUTY TO SAFEGUARD PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</h5>
<p>{{ site.name }} (the “Website”) and {{ site.name }} (collectively “{{ site.name }},” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are legally required to ensure that your electronic protected health information (“ePHI”) and/or protected health information (“PHI”) is kept private. ePHI and/or PHI, herein referred to collectively as “ePHI” (defined as any information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium, that: (i) is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse; and (ii) relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual, is health-related information created or noted by us that can be used to identify you.  It contains data about your past, present, or future health or condition, health care services provided to you, or the payment for such services. We are also required to provide you with this Notice about our privacy procedures, which explains when, why, and how we would “use” and/or “disclose” your ePHI. When we use your ePHI, we may share, apply, utilize, examine, or analyze information within our organization. Your ePHI is deemed disclosed when we release, transfer, give, or otherwise reveal it to a third party outside our organization. With some exceptions, we may not use or disclose more of your ePHI than is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the use or disclosure is made; however, we are always legally required to follow the privacy practices described in this Notice.
</p><p>Please note that we reserve the right to change the terms of this Notice and our privacy policies at any time as permitted by law. Any changes will apply to ePHI already on file with us. Before we make any important changes to our policies, we will immediately change this Notice and post a copy of it on our site. You may also request a copy of this Notice from us.</p>
</li><li><h5>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR ePHI.</h5>
<p>We will use and disclose your ePHI for many different reasons. Some of the uses or disclosures will require your prior written authorization; others, however, will not. Below you will find the different categories of our uses and disclosures, with some examples.</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>We may use and disclose your ePHI without your consent for the following care related purposes:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>For treatment.</strong> We may use your ePHI within our organization to provide you with mental health treatment, including discussing or sharing your ePHI with our authorized workforce members or Business Associates. We may disclose your ePHI to physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other licensed health care providers who provide you with health care services or are otherwise involved in your care. Example: If a psychiatrist is treating you, we may disclose your ePHI to her/him in order to coordinate your care.
</li><li><strong>For health care operations.</strong> We may disclose your ePHI to facilitate the efficient and correct operation of the Website. Examples:  Quality control - we might use your ePHI in the evaluation of the quality of health care services that you have received or to evaluate the performance of the health care professionals who provided you with these services. We may also provide your ePHI to our attorneys, accountants, consultants, and others to make sure that we are in compliance with applicable laws.
</li><li><strong>To obtain payment for treatment.</strong> We may provide your ePHI to our business associates for billing purposes.</li></ol>
</li><li><strong>We may use and/or disclose your ePHI without your consent or authorization for the following additional purposes:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>When disclosure is required by federal, state, or local law; judicial, board, or administrative proceedings; or law enforcement.</strong> Example: we may make a disclosure to the appropriate officials when a law requires us to report information to government agencies, law enforcement personnel, and/or in an administrative proceeding. 
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is compelled by a party to a proceeding before a court of an administrative agency pursuant to its lawful authority.</strong>
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is required by a search warrant lawfully issued to a governmental law enforcement agency.</strong>
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is compelled by the patient or the patient’s representative pursuant to California Health and Safety Codes or to corresponding federal statutes of regulations.</strong>
</li><li><strong>To avoid harm.</strong> We may provide ePHI to law enforcement personnel or persons able to prevent or mitigate a serious threat to the health or safety of a person or the public (including yourself).
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is compelled or permitted by the fact that you are in such mental or emotional condition as to be dangerous to yourself or the person or property of others, and if we determine that disclosure is necessary to prevent the threatened danger.</strong>
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is mandated by the California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting law.</strong> For example, if we have a reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect.
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is mandated by the State Elder/Dependent Adult Abuse Reporting law.</strong> For example, if we have a reasonable suspicion of elder abuse or dependent adult abuse.
</li><li><strong>Business Associates.</strong> We will provide some healthcare services and related functions through the use of contracts with business associates. When these services are contracted, we may disclose your health information to business associates so they can perform their jobs. We require our business associates to protect and safeguard your health information in accordance with all applicable federal laws.
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is compelled or permitted by the fact that you tell us of a serious/imminent threat of physical violence by you against a reasonably identifiable victim or victims (including yourself).</strong>
</li><li><strong>For public health activities.</strong> Example: In the event of your death, if a disclosure is permitted or compelled, we may need to give the county coroner information about you. <u>We may also disclose your health information to public health or other appropriate government authorities as follows:  A. We may use or disclose your health information to government authorities that are authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability, or conducting public health surveillance, investigations, and interventions. B. We may disclose your health information to government authorities that are authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse or neglect.</u>
</li><li><strong>For health oversight activities.</strong> Example: we may be required to provide information to assist the government in the course of an investigation or inspection of a health care organization or provider. These oversights include investigations, audits, inspections, and other actions. These are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government benefit programs, and entities subject to government regulatory programs and/or civil rights laws for which health information is necessary to determine compliance. We are required by law to disclose ePHI to the Secretary of HHS to investigate or determine compliance with the HIPAA privacy standards.
</li><li><strong>Food and Drug Administration (FDA):</strong>  We may use or disclose your health information to the FDA in connection with an FDA-regulated product or activity. Example: We may disclose to the FDA information concerning adverse events involving food, dietary supplements, product defects or problems, and information needed to track FDA-regulated products or to conduct product recalls, repairs, replacements, or look backs (including locating people who have received products that have been recalled or withdrawn), or post marketing surveillance.
</li><li><strong>For specific government functions.</strong> Examples: We may disclose ePHI of military personnel and veterans under certain circumstances. Also, we may disclose ePHI in the interests of national security, such as protecting the President of the United States or assisting with intelligence operations.
</li><li><strong>For research purposes.</strong> In certain circumstances, we may provide ePHI in order to conduct medical research.
</li><li><strong>For Workers' Compensation purposes.</strong> We may provide ePHI in order to comply with Workers' Compensation laws.
</li><li><strong>Appointment reminders and health related benefits or services.</strong> Examples: We may use ePHI to provide appointment reminders. We may use ePHI to give you information about alternative treatment options or other health care services or benefits we offer.

</li><li><strong>If disclosure is required or permitted to a health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law.</strong> For example, when compelled by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to investigate or assess our compliance with HIPAA regulations.
</li><li><strong>If disclosure is otherwise specifically required by law.</strong></li></ol>
</li><li><strong>Certain Uses and Disclosures Require You to Have the Opportunity to Object.</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Disclosures to family, friends, or others.</strong> We may provide your ePHI to a family member, friend, or other individual who you indicate is involved in your care or is responsible for the payment for your health care, unless you object in whole or in part.</li></ol>
</li><li><strong>Other Uses and Disclosures Require Your Prior Written Authorization.</strong> In any other situation not described in Sections IIA, IIB, and IIC above, we will request your written authorization before using or disclosing any of your ePHI. Even if you have signed an authorization to disclose your ePHI, you may later revoke that authorization, in writing, to stop any future uses and disclosures (assuming that we haven't taken any action subsequent to the original authorization) of your ePHI by us.
</li></ol>
</li><li><h5>WHAT RIGHTS YOU HAVE REGARDING YOUR ePHI</h5>
These are your rights with respect to your ePHI:
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>The Right to See and Get Copies of Your ePHI.</strong> In general, you have the right to see your ePHI that is in our possession, or to get copies of it; however, you must request it in writing. If we do not have your ePHI, but we know who does, we will advise you how you can get it. You will receive a response from us within 30 days of our receipt of your written request. Under certain circumstances, we may feel we must deny your request, but if we do, we will give you, in writing, the reasons for the denial. We will also explain your right to have our denial reviewed.
If you ask for copies of your ePHI, we will charge you not more than $.25 per page. We may see fit to provide you with a summary or explanation of the ePHI, but only if you agree to it, as well as to the cost, in advance.
</li><li><strong>The Right to Request Limits on Uses and Disclosures of Your ePHI.</strong> You have the right to ask that we limit how we use and disclose your ePHI. While we will consider your request, we are not legally bound to agree. If we do agree, we will put those limits in writing and abide by them except in emergency situations. You do not have the right to limit the uses and disclosures that we are legally required or permitted to make.
</li><li><strong>The Right to Choose How We Send Your ePHI to You.</strong> It is your right to ask that your ePHI be sent to you at an alternate address (for example, sending information to your work address rather than your home address) or by an alternate method (for example, via email instead of by regular mail). We are obliged to agree to your request, provided that we can give you the ePHI in the format you requested without undue inconvenience. We may not require an explanation from you as to the basis of your request as a condition of providing communications on a confidential basis.
</li><li><strong>The Right to Get a List of the Disclosures We Have Made.</strong> You are entitled to a list of disclosures of your ePHI that we have made. The list will not include uses or disclosures to which you have already consented, i.e., those for treatment, payment, or health care operations, sent directly to you or to your family; neither will the list include disclosures made for national security purposes or those made to corrections or law enforcement personnel. All disclosure records will be held for six years.
We will respond to your request for an accounting of disclosures within 60 days of receiving your request. The list we give you will include disclosures made in the previous six years, unless you indicate a shorter period. The list will include the date of the disclosure, to who ePHI was disclosed (including their address, if known), a description of the information disclosed, and the reason for the disclosure. We will provide the list to you at no cost, unless you make more than one request in the same year, in which case we will charge you a reasonable sum based on a set fee for each additional request.
</li><li><strong>The Right to Amend Your ePHI.</strong> If you believe that there is some error in your ePHI, or that important information has been omitted, it is your right to request that we correct the existing information or add the missing information. Your request and the reason for the request must be made in writing. You will receive a response within 60 days of our receipt of your request. We may deny your request, in writing, if we find that the ePHI is: (a) correct and complete; (b) forbidden to be disclosed; (c) not part of our records; or (d) written by someone other than us. Our denial must be in writing and must state the reasons for the denial. It must also explain your right to file a written statement objecting to the denial. If you do not file a written objection, you still have the right to ask that your request and any denial be attached to any future disclosures of your ePHI. If we approve your request, we will make the change(s) to your ePHI. Additionally, we will tell you that the changes have been made, and we will advise all others who need to know about the change(s) to your ePHI.
</li><li><strong>The Right to Get This Notice by Email.</strong> You have the right to get this notice by email. You also have the right to request a paper copy.</li></ol>
</li><li><h5>NON- VIOLATION OF THIS NOTICE:</h5>
<strong>We are not in violation of this Notice or the HIPAA Privacy Rule if any of our workforce members or our business associates disclosed ePHI under the following circumstances:
<ol type="1">
<li>Disclosures by Whistleblowers:  If a workforce member or a business associate in good faith believes that we have engaged in conduct that is unlawful or otherwise violates clinical and professional standards or that the services or care provided by our organizations has the potential of endangering one or more users or workforce members or the public and discloses such information to: 
<ol type="a">
<li>A Public Health Authority or Health Oversight Authority authorized by law to investigate or otherwise oversee the relevant conduct or conditions, or the suspected violation, or an appropriate health care accreditation organization for the purpose of reporting the allegation of failure to meet professional standards or misconduct.
