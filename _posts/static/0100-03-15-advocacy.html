<h1>Patient Advocacy Program</h1>
<h2>Program Description</h2>
<p>My First Call Buddy, provides peace of mind, resources, and tools, to help navigate the healthcare system, as we know it today.

<h2>Benefit Provider Background</h2>
<p>Since 1988, First Call Nursing, Inc, has become one of the nation’s leading nursing contracting companies delivering qualified medical professionals to private hospitals, Kaiser, and the Veterans Administration.  We employ over 150 nurses nationwide.</p>
<p>We developed My First Call Buddy to fill the void in the consumer support side of the healthcare system. My First Call Buddy assists its members with virtually any aspect of their healthcare support needs. We foster a member centered relationship, to help our clientele plan ahead, one medical issue at a time. In today's fast paced world, with social media, 60 hour work weeks, and a new drug commercial helping us diagnose ourselves, we need a buddy we can rely on, to help answer our calls, when we have time, not when they can squeeze us in to their schedule.</p>
<p>Enjoy freedom of alternative approaches to healthcare, access to holistic resources, educational and much more. The key to our success is building a team around you.  You are central to our success, not the other way around.</p>
